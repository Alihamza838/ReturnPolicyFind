This page covers the no-receipt path specifically. For Walmart's full return policy — including category-by-category windows and refund methods — see the [complete Walmart return policy guide](/stores/walmart).

### The fast version
No receipt doesn't mean no return. Walmart will look up eligible purchases using a valid photo ID, but the refund options are narrower than a standard receipted return: exchange, Walmart gift card, or a manufacturer-repair referral.

### The ID Tracking System
Walmart uses a secure verification database to track returns made without a receipt. If a customer exceeds the permitted frequency or monetary caps within a rolling 45-day window, the system may flag and automatically decline subsequent returns.

This page is a specialized deep-dive on Target's no-receipt policies. To view the standard target terms including category-by-category windows, see the [main Target return policy page](/stores/target).

### The receipt recovery options
Target has built an extremely modern lookup system. You rarely have to rely on raw ID returns because:
- **Card Lookup:** Registries search swipes of MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover, RedCard, and personal checks.
- **Circle Barcode:** Scanning your loyalty app barcode captures in-store and online receipts automatically.

### The $150 Annual ID Ceiling
If all lookup options fail, Target can approve a return based on your photo ID. However, Target restricts these unverified returns to **$150 per calendar year** per customer ID to prevent retail fraud.
